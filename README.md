# Purpose
I need to learn more about design patterns for some upcoming projects so I created this scrapyard project to
learn and practice the various design patterns.

For the moment this project will be in Kotlin but I may extend it to include other languages in future.

### Note
I'm following along with the examples on [tutorials point](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern).
I'll be changing out the examples for my own when I think of any.

### Patterns Implemented
* Factory
* Singleton
* Builder
* Prototype
